# CIVIL-459-Project
Project description
--------------------
This project is part of EPFL Deep Learning for Autonomous Vehicles class, aiming to solve one sub-task related to autonomous driving: lane detection. Despite the state-of-the-art 3d lane detection models like [PersFormer](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/PersFormer_3DLane) using anchor-based perspective transformer to transform front-eye-view features to bird-eye view features, we get the idea from pose-estimation
